## Core concepts:

**Vault**: A folder that holds your markdown files, just like in Obsidian. AssistantMD can be set up with one or many vaults, but the vaults remain isolated during operations.

**Assistant**: A markdown file that defines a scheduled workflow. Store these inside your vault in a folder called "assistants". Assistants are vault-scoped, meaning they can only access the files in the vault they live in.
