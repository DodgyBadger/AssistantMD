# Content Import

`content_import` submits URLs or vault files to the durable ingestion pipeline
and reads the resulting job status. Imported content is written as vault
artifacts under the configured ingestion output path. Markdown files land
directly in the selected destination. Optional companion files are grouped under
`assets/<import-name>/` within that destination.

## Submit

Use `operation="submit"` with one source or a list of sources:

```text
content_import(
  operation="submit",
  sources=["https://example.org/report.pdf", "Research/local.pdf"]
)
```

Sources may be public HTTP/HTTPS URLs or vault-relative file paths. Vault files
are preserved after import. The call queues one durable ingestion job per source
and returns promptly; it does not wait for extraction to finish. The returned
JSON includes an `items` array with the `job_id`, source, source kind, and queued
status for every accepted source. Retain those job ids to inspect the jobs later.

Optional `options`:

- `destination`: vault-relative output directory for this import; when omitted,
  the configured `ingestion_output_path_pattern` is used
- `pdf_mode`: `markdown` or `page_images`
- `strategies`: ordered extraction strategy names
- `pdf_strategies`: ordered extraction strategies applied only after a URL or
  vault file is classified as a PDF; useful for extensionless document URLs
- `capture_ocr_images`: save images extracted by Mistral under the import's
  assets directory and rewrite matching Markdown image links; increases the
  provider response size and vault storage
- `include_ocr_blocks`: retain labeled blocks in reading order, including their
  page bounding boxes; useful for scripted layout analysis, but unnecessary for
  ordinary Markdown imports
- `ocr_table_format`: `markdown` or `html`; additionally retain tables as
  separate structured values in OCR metadata. Use `html` for complex or merged
  cells; omit this option to keep tables inline in the page Markdown
- `extract_ocr_header`: remove detected page headers from the main Markdown and
  retain them separately in OCR metadata
- `extract_ocr_footer`: remove detected page footers from the main Markdown and
  retain them separately in OCR metadata
- `ocr_confidence`: `page` for compact page-level review scores or `word` for
  detailed per-word scores and substantially larger metadata
- `clean_html`: boolean

OCR enrichment options are opt-in. When requested structured data is returned,
it is stored under `assets/<import-name>/ocr.json` and referenced by the imported
Markdown frontmatter.

OCR requires a configured `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, non-empty
`ingestion_ocr_endpoint` and `ingestion_ocr_model` settings, and the `pdf_ocr`
strategy. If OCR is unavailable, do not request OCR enrichments; use the default
local PDF import or report the missing configuration to the user.

For routine research imports, omit all OCR enrichment options. Use
`options={"strategies": ["pdf_ocr"]}` for scanned or layout-heavy PDFs, add
`"capture_ocr_images": true` when figures matter, and add
`"ocr_confidence": "page"` when low-quality pages need review. Blocks, separate
tables, and word confidence are primarily intended for deterministic downstream
scripts. PDF enrichment options affect `pdf_ocr`; local `pdf_text` extraction
ignores them.

The maximum sources accepted per call is controlled by the editable
`content_import_max_batch_size` setting, which defaults to 20.

## Status

Use `operation="status"` with one job id or a list of job ids:

```text
content_import(operation="status", job_ids=[41, 42])
```

The returned JSON includes an `items` array with the job id, source, source kind,
current state, output paths, any durable ingestion error, strategies attempted,
the selected strategy/provider/model, and any fallback reason. Selection fields
remain empty while a job is queued or when no extractor succeeds. A caller can
choose when to inspect queued work; the tool does not define research progress
or retry policy.

## Boundaries

- File paths are resolved inside the active vault. Absolute paths, traversal,
  symlink escapes, and virtual mounts are rejected.
- URL loading uses the configured ingestion transport, public-network policy,
  timeouts, and response-size limit.
- Initial remote conversion supports HTML and PDF responses.
- The tool does not search for sources, organize a library, summarize results,
  or track which sources a research effort still needs.
