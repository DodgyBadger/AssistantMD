# `web_extract`

## Purpose

Extract readable content from known URLs using the extraction strategy selected
in System settings. Extraction is transient and does not import content into the
vault.

## Arguments

- `urls`: one URL or a list of up to ten URLs
- `include_images`: request image metadata from strategies that support it;
  defaults to `false`. A selected strategy that cannot honor the option fails
  clearly rather than ignoring it.

## Example

```python
web_extract(
    urls=[
        "https://example.com/docs/a",
        "https://example.com/docs/b",
    ]
)
```

Successful content is grouped by URL and wrapped as untrusted web data. Partial
provider failures remain visible beside successful results. If every URL fails,
the tool returns a structured failure identifying the configured strategy.

Use `browser` explicitly for dynamic pages that require Chromium. The tool does
not launch a browser or change extraction strategies automatically.
