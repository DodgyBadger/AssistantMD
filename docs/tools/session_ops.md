# `session_ops`

## Purpose

Search prior chat sessions and create or update lightweight session summaries.

This tool is available to chat and context scripts as the direct operation
surface for prior-session lookup, transcript search, and session-summary
updates.

The selected runtime vault is always the scope. Do not pass or infer a vault
parameter.

## Parameters

- `operation`: required. Supported values are `list_sessions`, `summarize_session`,
  `upsert_session_summary`, `get_session_summary`, and `search_sessions`.
- `session_id`: optional explicit session id. Defaults to the active session
  when available.
- `mode`: optional search mode for `search_sessions`. Supported values are
  `search` and `deep`. Defaults to `search`.
- `query`: search phrase for the default `search` mode and for `deep` mode.
- `limit`: optional positive integer result limit. Defaults to 50 for
  `list_sessions` and 5 for `search_sessions`. `list_sessions` rejects limits
  above 100.
- `cursor`: optional pagination cursor for `list_sessions`; use the
  `next_cursor` returned by a prior `list_sessions` call.
- `summary_status`: optional `list_sessions` filter. Defaults to `summarized`,
  which includes only sessions with stored summaries. Supported values are
  `summarized`, `any`, `current`, `pending`, and `stale`.
- `data`: optional object for `upsert_session_summary`. Supported keys are
  `summary`, `domain`, `work_product`, `user_intent`, `named_entities`,
  `source_summary`, `artifacts`, and `metadata`.
- `summarization_model`: optional model alias for `summarize_session`.

## Session Summary Field Contract

Use these fields as short summaries of one chat session. Prefer durable
descriptions of the user's work over momentary prompt phrasing.

- `summary`: compact plain-language summary of the session's durable outcome.
  Capture what happened, the main result or decision, and any important
  unresolved follow-up. Include only enough detail for a human or future
  assistant to decide whether the session is relevant; do not preserve a full
  process log. Target 500-800 characters and never exceed 1,000 characters.
- `domain`: semicolon-separated subject-area tags for the work. Use one to
  three compact noun phrases, such as `NAWCA grant writing; conservation
  proposal planning`, `data visualization`, `ServiceNow administration`, or
  `research synthesis`.
- `work_product`: the concrete thing the user wanted produced or answered, such
  as `Python script`, `recipe`, `article summary`, `stacked bar chart`,
  `rewrite`, `donor email`, or `factual answer`.
- `user_intent`: the user's underlying goal or intent after clarification,
  repetition, or topic drift. Write this as a concise intent phrase that keeps
  the action-purpose relationship. Choose one primary durable goal rather than
  listing every sub-task. Omit boilerplate such as `the user wanted to`; target
  10-22 words and never exceed 140 characters.
- `named_entities`: only named people, organizations, and places. Use a concise
  comma- or semicolon-separated text list. Leave empty if there are no named
  people, organizations, or places.
- `source_summary`: concise bullets summarizing source material or prior
  context the session appears to have drawn on, based on tool calls/results and
  the session summary. A source is material that was read, retrieved, imported,
  or pasted into the session, such as a vault file, web page, imported document,
  or user-provided source text. Do not create extra bullets for documents,
  datasets, tools, or evidence that were only mentioned inside another source.
  The session summary, user intent, and tool log are extraction evidence, not
  source labels. Do not judge source quality. `source_summary` is returned as
  provenance for grounding; it is not used as an indexed retrieval field.

For manual writes, put these fields inside `data`. On an existing record,
omitted fields are preserved; pass `null` or an empty string to explicitly clear
a field. `data.artifacts` is an
optional list of artifact objects with `path`, optional `artifact_role`, and
`metadata`. `data.metadata` is optional JSON object metadata for the stored
session summary row.

## Output Shape

Returns pretty-printed JSON text. Successful operations include a stable
`status` and `operation` value, plus operation-specific data such as
`session_summary` or ranked `matches`.

## Notes

- `list_sessions` returns a compact page of summarized chat-session rows ordered
  by latest activity. It is for browsing and overview work, not semantic
  retrieval. Rows include `session_id`, title, timestamps, message count,
  history revision, summary status, `domain`, and `user_intent`. It also returns
  `total_count`, `returned_count`, and `next_cursor` so callers do not mistake a
  page for the whole available summary set. Use `summary_status: "pending"`
  only when explicitly looking for sessions that still need summarization.
- `get_session_summary` is read-only. It fetches the stored summary for the current
  or specified session and returns `status: "found"` or `status: "not_found"`.
- `summarize_session` reads the transcript and structured tool events for
  the current or specified session, runs AssistantMD's standard extraction
  policy, upserts the resulting summary fields, attaches any vault files mutated
  by that chat session as artifacts, and indexes vector-searchable fields.
- `upsert_session_summary` manually stores the `data` values supplied by the
  caller for the current or specified session. It does not read the transcript
  or infer missing fields. When updating an existing summary, omitted fields are
  preserved; pass `null` or an empty string to explicitly clear a field.
- `search_sessions` finds candidate prior sessions.
  - `mode: "search"` is the default. It searches the supplied `query` across session-summary fields using
    lexical FTS/BM25 evidence plus semantic vector evidence.
  - `mode: "deep"` searches session-summary fields plus raw chat transcripts.
- Use `search` for normal live-chat lookup when the current session does not
  yet have a stored summary, or when the user names a specific word, phrase, topic,
  or concept.
- Use `deep` when the user asks for a broader or transcript-level search.
- For `search` and `deep`, include `query` as a plain natural-language phrase.
  Do not use explicit boolean syntax such as uppercase `AND`/`OR`. Use a
  positive integer `limit`.
