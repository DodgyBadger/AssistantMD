# chat_history_compact

Check or compact the current chat session history.

Use `operation="status"` to inspect the current message and token estimate. Use
`operation="compact"` only after the user has explicitly approved compaction.

Parameters:

- `operation`: `status` or `compact`
- `focus`: optional user guidance for what the compaction summary should preserve

The compact operation records a replay checkpoint so default future history
starts with a system-maintained summary plus recent raw turns.
