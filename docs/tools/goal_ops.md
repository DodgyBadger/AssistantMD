# goal_ops

Track durable goals and compact recovery checkpoints for longer work.

`goal_ops` records state only. It does not execute work, write files, schedule
workflows, or automatically retry tool calls. Use workflows for repeated or
procedural automation; use normal vault markdown files for reports, drafts,
evidence, and detailed work logs.

Use `goal_ops` when work is too large, durable, or interruptible to track
reliably in the current chat alone. Do not create goals for ordinary questions,
quick edits, simple lookups, single-turn answers, or tasks that can be completed
immediately.

Metadata fields are freeform compact JSON objects owned by the caller. Use them
for small, stable hints such as workflow names, local tags, ids, or source-path
references. Do not embed large notes, reports, extracted evidence, or drafts in
metadata; write those to normal vault markdown files and reference the path.

Goal source provenance is system-owned and may appear in results for audit and
lookup. Do not provide source fields when creating or updating goals.

Common operations:

- `create_goal`: create a goal.
- `list_goals`: list goals in the active vault.
- `get_goal`: fetch a goal with its latest checkpoint.
- `update_goal`: update title, objective, status, workspace hint, success criteria, plan, or metadata.
- `checkpoint`: record a compact recovery checkpoint.
- `list_activity`: list existing vault mutation activity associated with a goal, including mutated file paths.

Parameters:

- `operation`: required operation name.
- `goal_id`: required for goal-specific operations.
- `status`: optional `list_goals` status filter. Use `"any"` for no status filter.
- `query`: optional `list_goals` title/objective search.
- `limit`: optional result limit.
- `workspace_path_hint`: optional non-authoritative workspace hint filter.
- `data`: operation-specific object payload.

For `list_goals`, `data.source` can narrow results to goals created from a chat
session without exposing internal provenance fields:

- `"current_session"`: goals created from the active chat session.
- `"session"`: goals created from `data.session_id`.

`plan` is an optional JSON snapshot on the goal. Keep it lightweight: a short
markdown string, a list of task objects, or another compact shape that helps the
agent resume work. Replace it through `update_goal`; do not use it for large
notes or work products.

Create a goal:

```json
{
  "operation": "create_goal",
  "data": {
    "title": "Prepare Acme renewal briefing",
    "objective": "Create a renewal briefing from project notes and recent meetings.",
    "workspace_path_hint": "Clients/Acme",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Draft briefing exists",
      "Open questions are listed",
      "Source notes are cited"
    ],
    "plan": [
      {"text": "Review source notes", "status": "pending"},
      {"text": "Draft briefing", "status": "pending"},
      {"text": "List open questions", "status": "pending"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Update progress:

```json
{
  "operation": "update_goal",
  "goal_id": "goal_abc",
  "data": {
    "plan": [
      {"text": "Review source notes", "status": "completed"},
      {"text": "Draft briefing", "status": "in_progress"},
      {"text": "List open questions", "status": "pending"}
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "draft_path": "Clients/Acme/renewal-briefing.md"
    }
  }
}
```

Record a checkpoint:

```json
{
  "operation": "checkpoint",
  "goal_id": "goal_abc",
  "data": {
    "summary": "Reviewed May and June notes. Main renewal risks are pricing and security review ownership.",
    "current_state": "Draft briefing is started.",
    "next_actions": ["Pull source quotes", "Finish risk table"],
    "open_questions": ["Should pricing recommendation be conservative or aggressive?"],
    "risks": ["Security owner is unclear"]
  }
}
```

List active goals for a workspace:

```json
{
  "operation": "list_goals",
  "status": "active",
  "workspace_path_hint": "Clients/Acme"
}
```

Search goals by title or objective:

```json
{
  "operation": "list_goals",
  "query": "renewal briefing",
  "limit": 5
}
```

List goals created in the current chat session:

```json
{
  "operation": "list_goals",
  "data": {
    "source": "current_session",
    "status": "any"
  }
}
```

Goal activity is derived from the existing vault mutation recorder when work
runs with goal context. Use `list_activity` to inspect task-level mutation
groups and file paths. `goal_ops` does not attach files or create artifacts.
