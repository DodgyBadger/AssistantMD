# Upgrading

⚠️ Beta software. Check the [release notes](https://github.com/DodgyBadger/AssistantMD/releases/latest) before upgrading.

## Upgrading to v0.8.0

1. Back up your vaults, `system/`, `.env`, and current Compose files. Keep the `.env` backup separate because it contains the key needed to read encrypted credentials.

2. v0.8 tracks `docker-compose.yml` so later pulls automatically receive required topology changes. In an existing repository checkout, preserve your old local file before pulling:

   ```bash
   mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.pre-v0.8.yml
   git pull --ff-only
   ```

   Do not copy the old file back over the new tracked `docker-compose.yml`.

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if needed. Preserve an existing encryption key; otherwise follow [Configure `.env`](installation.md#4-configure-env) to generate one. Move the old Compose values into `.env`:

   ```dotenv
   ASSISTANTMD_DATA_PATH=/old/host/path/previously-mounted-at-app-data
   ASSISTANTMD_SYSTEM_PATH=/old/host/path/previously-mounted-at-app-system
   ```

   Also preserve the timezone, authentication mode, authentication secret, and public URL appropriate to the deployment.

4. Move structural customizations—custom builds or UID/GID, external proxy networks, and extra bind mounts—into `docker-compose.override.yml`. Start from `docker-compose.override.yml.example` and copy only the sections you need. Do not edit the tracked `docker-compose.yml`.

5. If you want advanced mode, add these values to `.env`; otherwise leave them unset:

   ```dotenv
   COMPOSE_PROFILES=advanced
   ASSISTANTMD_EXECUTION_MODE=advanced
   ```

6. Validate and restart the deployment:

   ```bash
   docker compose config --quiet
   docker compose down
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   For a repository build using the override example, replace `docker compose pull` with `docker compose build`. The override builds both Assistant.md and the advanced shell from the same checkout when the `advanced` profile is active.

7. Open **System → Infrastructure** and confirm the expected authentication and execution modes. Advanced mode is ready when the advanced shell reports `ready`.

8. If you use the packaged default context script, refresh system scripts under **System → Misc**. Save any custom changes to the existing system script first; refresh installs the current soul and playbook loading behavior.

9. Confirm that model-provider API keys were imported, then reconnect every existing OAuth account. Legacy OAuth state is not imported into the encrypted store. Configure and test Gmail and MCP connections under **System → Connections**. Gmail attachment downloads and draft creation remain disabled on each connection until explicitly enabled; enabling drafts requires reauthorizing that connection for Gmail compose permission.

On first v0.8.0 startup, Assistant.md migrates legacy non-OAuth static secrets into encrypted storage and keeps the old file at `system/migration_backups/secrets.yaml.bak`, or the next available numbered name when that file already exists. Routine `docker compose down` preserves advanced-shell pairing, installed files, and workspace data. Do not add `-v` unless you deliberately want to delete those Docker volumes.

## Model aliases during upgrades

Model aliases are part of the authoring contract because context scripts, workflows, and other automation can refer to them directly. Keep an existing alias stable when changing the provider model it resolves to. If you rename or remove an alias, update every script and setting that refers to it in the same change.

Packaged model defaults live in `core/settings/settings.template.yaml`, while the active mappings live in the persistent `system/settings.yaml`. Settings repair copies only new or missing model entries from the packaged template; it never overwrites an existing entry with the same alias, and it preserves user-defined models.

When an upgrade changes the packaged `model_string` for an existing alias, delete that alias's complete entry from the `models` section of `system/settings.yaml`, then run **Repair settings from template**. The repair action creates a settings backup and recreates the missing entry from the current packaged seed. Do not delete customized model entries unless you intend to replace those customizations with the packaged defaults.
