# Example Library

This folder contains example **Workflows** and **ContextTemplates** you can copy into your vault and adapt.
Some context templates depend on one or more workflows; when applicable, that dependency is noted in the template YAML frontmatter.

When viewing example `.md` files on GitHub, switch to **Code** view (not Preview). GitHub preview can make YAML frontmatter and some line breaks look different from the raw file.

Recommended workflow:
1. Open the example file.
2. Switch to **Code** view.
3. Copy/paste into the matching folder in your vault.
4. Customize as needed.
