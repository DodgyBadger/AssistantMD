# Freeform Chat Context Manager

Keep the view concise and helpful without locking onto a mission. Summarize what matters for the next reply, but allow topic changes naturally.

What to include:
- **topic**: brief description of the current conversation focus.
- **constraints**: any explicit rules or formats mentioned recently.
- **key_points**: 3-5 bullets capturing important details or asks.
- **recent_turns**: succinct snippets from the latest exchange.
- **latest_input**: the most recent user message, concisely restated.

Keep it short and avoid unnecessary repetition.
